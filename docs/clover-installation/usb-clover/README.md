# Configuring Clover in Windows

## Part 1 - Config and Kexts

1. Once finished, you should be able to see a new partition called `CLOVER` is mounted. Open it and go into `EFI/CLOVER`.
2. Make a config.plist with [this guide](../config/) and replace the original one with the config.plist you've made in `EFI/CLOVER`.
3. After that, put all the kexts you have downloaded \(in [Gathering Kexts page](../../prerequisites/get-started/README#gathering-kexts)\) to `EFI/CLOVER/kexts/Other` folder. **Skip all of the SMC kexts** \(except VirtualSMC.kext and FakeSMC.kext\) as they might cause Kernel Panic\(s\).
4. And delete the FakeSMC.kext. \(if you are using VirtualSMC.kext\)

## Part 2 - Drivers

#### For UEFI:

1. Go back to `EFI/CLOVER` and go into `drivers/UEFI`
2. Delete everything **except**:
    - `ApfsDriverLoader.efi`
    - `AptioMemoryFix.efi`
    - `HFSPlus.efi`
3. Yay! You are ready to [install macOS](../../actual-installation/actual-installation-part-1.md)!ðŸ¥³
